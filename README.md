# Health Monitor

Application to receive health data from smart devices and use AI to find anomalies.

You can send health data of some activity by an endpoint and get some anomalies found by AI running asynchronously
in another one.

## Stack and technologies
- PHP 8.2
- Laravel 10
- Docker & Docker compose
- MySql 8
- Kafka
- OpenAI API

## Components

| Component     | Address               |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| api           | http://localhost:9501 |
| worker        | Background job        |
| Apache kafka  | http://localhost:7002 |
| Mysql         | http://localhost:8080 |

## Get started

### Install

Just clone this repository, run setup and migrations

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/lukkas-lukkas/health-monitor.git
cd health-monitor
make setup
make migrate
```
ðŸš© **Tip:** If you see an error when trying to run the migrations, wait a second and try again; the container needs some time to be run.

## Usage

First, you must know that **AI is disabled** by default. And with this, you can use the simulator to have some fun
seeing a job sending a lot of data and consuming it in the background.

### Enable AI

We use OpenAI API, so you must have a key provided by OpenAI to enable it. 

Then set the environment variables `ENABLE_AI=true` and `OPENAI_API_TOKEN=(your-api-key)`

After that, restart the containers running:
``` shell
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Sending data
``` curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:9501/api/v1/users/{userID}/health-data' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "started_at": "2024-02-09T15:00:30",
    "finished_at": "2024-02-09T16:00:00",
    "avg_bpm": 500,
    "steps_total": 5000
}'
```
| Field               | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| userID              | Any string ID you will use to get the result |
| started_at          | When the activity started                        |
| finished_at         | When the activity finished                       |
| avg_bpm             | Average bit per minute                           |
| steps_total         | Total of steps during the activity               |

### Getting the result
``` curl
curl --location 'http://localhost:9501/api/v1/users/{userID}/health-data'
```
The anomalies can have some seconds to appear, and you can check the execution running `docker logs -f worker-health-monitor`

## Simulator

As mentioned, you can run a simulator to see the app sending a lot of random information to be processed.
As long as the AI is disabled.

``` shell
make run-simulator quantity=10 delay=2
```
The parameters quantity and delay are optional, with 100 and 1 as default, respectively.

Now you can check the values on the database table ``health_data`` and the worker's logs.
